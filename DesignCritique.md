# Critique by Design

1. Critique on existing visualization (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/24/us/texas-school-shooting-deaths.html)

![Mass Shooting_nyt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112817162/190920349-98df046d-7ebc-45cc-8235-00371649ad19.JPG)

The vastness of active school shooting incidents over the US really stood out to me as they are spread all over the map. In addition, the death tolls of those incidents are indicated in big fonts and highlighted in dark red, further emphasizing the somber nature of mass shootings. 
However, the visualization could also contribute to information overload as information related to each mass shooting event, from year to location to the death toll are treated equally. Even though there’s a lot of information, there is a lack of focus based on the title, “Deadliest active shooter attacks at schools since 1970” as readers have to filter through all the information across the map to realize the deadliest event that took place in Newtown, CT. 
If I were the author of the visualization, I’d keep the map as the basis but add heap-map features, such as bubbles to highlight the severity of each event based on the dead toll. I’d also mark the bubbles as death tolls aside from the main graph and only put numbers in the center of each bubble to provide a simple and direct message. 

The primary audience for this visualization would be the general public, especially people who are interested in knowing more about school-related mass shooting situations in the US. I think this visualization is effective in providing a high-level history; nonetheless, it lacks focus to reflect the “deadliest” occasion based on the visualization’s header, which could lead to information overload. 

2. Revised Visulization

1) Sketch 
![Rough Sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112817162/190920548-a1f0e9b5-270e-43d6-9cd2-fabb8e787555.jpg)


2) Interview

2.1) 
Interviewee: student, mid 20s
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
  It is a map that details the death tolls of different mass shootings that happened in school from 1970s. 
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
  Year, place and death tolls of each shooting while the bubble indicates the level of casulty. 
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  I find it informative overall but there's probably too much information in a bubble; I am more concerned about the death tolls, which should be highlighted 
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
  I'd imagine to be legislators/policy makers on gun control but it also could be for the wider public who's interested in that issue as well. 
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  I'd keep the map format but make the bubbles more clearly defined with key information, such as casulty. 

2.2) 
Interviewee: student, mid 20s
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
  A map that indicates mass shootings from 1970s.
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
  Information related to each mass shooting, such as year, city and number of casulty. 
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  I like how the bubbles capture the level of casulty amongest those shootings; they are very easy to understand and help highlight the severity. 
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
  I think it's for whoever is interested in knowing more about mass school shootings.
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  I'd make the color change based on the number of casulties as well, aside from the size of the bubble just to make the visualization more visually indicative. 


3 Visualization

Based on the feedback, I removed information, such as year and city from my original sketch to highlight the most important piece of information, which is the casulties of each shooting. Year and city information are added to the tooltips so they are still available in case users are interested in further exploration. In addition, I incorporated a gradient color scheme to further highlight the level of severity of each mass shooting. Besides, I added a slider as filter that allows users to understand the scope of mass shootings over the years.
