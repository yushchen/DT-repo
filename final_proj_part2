# User research and interviews
Target audienceï¼›People who are unaware of the role nuclear energy plays in the US
Approach to identifying representative individuals to interivew: 
- Start with friends and classmates who share common interests and experiences
- Ask them about their understanding of nuclear energy and engage if the answer is vague/unclear
- Ensure the people who I plan to engage are interested in knowing more about nuclear energy 

Your interview script:
- Schedule a 1x1 Zoom call with individuals defined by the above criteria
- Walk them through the Shorthand website  
- Focus on the last part which involves action steps and get feedback from interviewees

Findings from your interviews (3 interviewees):
1) History section: 
- Text description doesn't include information on the attached visualization
- Visualization title doesn't provide much value to the context 
- Need to emphasize more on the pattern of decline 
2) Public attitude:
- Not only it's important to show the decline of nuclear but also compare that with other energy sources
- Why are there mixed views? You need to demonstrate smoother transition into the next section
- I like the color code which brings clarity to the text
3) The importance of nuclear
- The dashboard view looks great, a good way to combine similar information into one
- Clear title and chart color
- Need to provide information on technical terms, such as greenhouse emission and capacity factor

Changes I plan on implementing
- Integrate description of the visualization into main text
- Have a better transition through different sections
- Provide more context of the importance of nuclear based on comparisons with other energy sources
