# Final Data Story

# Changes I've made since the completion of Part II
1) Updated the visualization that tracks the number of nuclear reactors built in the US
- Expand the view in Shorthand in order to fit the size of the visualization
- Highlight the trend while providing more context on cut-off points, such as the peak, the plateau afterwards, etc.
2) Changed the color scheme of the visualization that compares and contrasts crude oil and nuclear energy
- Used the color red for crude oil and green for nuclear energy, signaling their environmental-friendliness 
3) Expanded write-ups in the call to action section 
- Researched nuclear advocacy groups
- Stressed the importance of working with legislators as those are the ones influencing the current/future of nuclear reactor development in the US

# Findings along the way:
- More and more people are starting to question the status quo of the stagnating number of nuclear reactors in the US, primarily driven by the 
energy crisis that's been going on in Europe. 
- Based on my interviews, most of the opponents to nuclear energy cited reasons like safety concerns but after I provided specific evidence, they were quite surprised by how safe nuclear energy is. I hope such education could take place more frequently as a lot of people in the US are still living under the fear of three mile island and Fukushima incidents, which are preventable.
