# Outline
My final project focuses on the evolution of nuclear energy in the US and its reflection on pulic perceptions, government policies over the years while sheding light on the role of nuclear in fighting climate change.
The project will be presented in the following structure:
1. History of nuclear energy 
2. Current state of nuclear energy 
3. The role of nuclear energy in energy generation overall
4. What can we do with nuclear in fighting climate change

# Initial Sketches
**History of nulcear energy**: I plan to integrate a map that indicates the rise and fall of nuclear reactors in the US over the years. In addition, I envision adding multiple layers
on top of the quantity, such as animation to provide a more capturing and informative look. Aside from the visualization, I am going to write a short description of the history just to add more context.

Sample Visualization:

**Current state of nuclear energy**: This is a part where I will share the evoltuion of public perceptions, especially those before and after the three mile island and how that trickles into changes in public policies
of the nuclear use in the US. This time, I will compare the number of nuclear reactors built in the US vs. other countries in fixed time horizons in the past. The comparison will allow readers to understand how the rest of the world is catching up 
in terms of product reliance on nuclear energy.

**The role of nuclear energy in energy generation overall**: I will seek to demonstrate the share of nuclear energy in the total energy produced in the US and its importance in the clean energy space (comparing nuclear to
wind, solar, etc.)

**What can we do with nuclear in fighting climate change**: The public perception towards nuclear has continued to be passive in general in the US. I hope to convince those who are still skeptical of nuclear energy to embrace it as it is crucial to helping 
climate change. There will be a call to action at the end as well. 


# The data
I will rely data from the following sources:
- US Department of Energy
- US Energy Information Administration
- International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
- US Neclear Regulatory Commission
- And more...

# Method and Medium
- Data visualization: Tableau
- Website development and presentation: Shorthand
